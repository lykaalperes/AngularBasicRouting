## Then created a folder for the components inside the folder “app”, after that I created 4 components which are; login, signup, homepage, and landing page.

## Next is I create a app.module.ts to set-up, import, configure, and define my route.

## Then I removed the standalone: true and imports: [] in all the components typescripts to make them all connected.
